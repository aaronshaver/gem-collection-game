* Use Swift
* Prefer standard libraries to do heavy lifting and not reinvent the wheel, e.g. use Spritekit instead of inventing your own sprite engine, use SF Symbols if there's a good match for an icon, etc.
* Use modular architecture, e.g. don't do thousands of lines of logic in one big file: break up into logically separated files so each file is responsible for one area
* Take advantage of unit testing to enforce game logic and prevent regressions
* Aim for a rock solid 60 FPS minimum performance level, even if it means less visual fidelity or other sacrifices
* Don't use any libraries/tools/functions that wouldn't work on an iPhone 13; that's our target minimum platform
* But within the phone version and performance requirements, aim for a beautiful presentation: lush, vibrant, clean, modern, slick
* Do not use emojis in the app unless specifically asked
* Remind the user about standard mobile development practices (user is a backend developer who doesn't have a lot of mobile app development experience) where it's helpful. Prefer doing things in a modern, standard way unless the user explicitly overrides that after you ask the user during a choice point.
* Don't modify any .md file unless user asks for it or unless you ask for specific permission and explain the need for it
* Since the model (you) using the simulator can slow down the user's Mac and/or mean a fight for control of the simulator, default to asking the user for simulator use if you need to use it, explaining the specific need and only proceed if permission is granted each time.
* Do not spam the UI with LLM fluff text. Only add explanatory UI text when the user explicitly asks for it. You may suggest explanatory text, but do not add it without the user’s confirmation.
